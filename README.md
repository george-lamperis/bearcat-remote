bearcat-remote
==============
This program provides an alternate way to contral a Uniden Bearcat BC125AT
handheld scanner (http://www.uniden.com/scanners/bearcat-handheld-scanner/invt/bc125atg).

To use this program, connect your scanner to your computer using USB, then start
bearcat-remote. The user interface looks very similar to the buttons on your
Bearcat. All of the buttons behave just as they do on your scanner.
